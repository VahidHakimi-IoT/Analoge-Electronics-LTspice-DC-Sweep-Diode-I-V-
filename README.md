in this example I want to obtain the I-V characteristic of Dioide. DC sweep analysis is used for this purpose.![Assignment 2 2 2026-01-30  figure](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bb36e3dd-6c49-472f-8fbb-e2a5c4b2ba41)

plot shows the diode current increasing almost linearly as the input DC voltage is swept from 0 to 15 V, due to the 1 kΩ series resistor limiting the current.The DC sweep is from 0 V to 15 V with a step of 1 V (.dc V1 0 15 1).
